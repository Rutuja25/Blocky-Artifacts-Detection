# Blocky-Artifacts-Detection
Blocky Artifacts Detection Algorithm for Compressed Digital Image

This is an implementation of the proposed method to detect blocky artifacts in paper [1].

## How to use?

To load you own image, change the image src in Typescript-File *BlockyAD.ts*.

`var img = new NRImage('.\\imgs\\compressed.png');`

To play around with the threshold, just use the slider.
